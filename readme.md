This is a project for building a simple decentralized exchage.

We are using `react.js` for the frontend.
Here we will also be using a `css` preprocessor known as `stylus(stylus-lang.com)`, which helps to write `css` without brackets and nested classes, among many other nice features. You can install it as follows:

[npm i -S style-loader css-loader stylus-loader stylus]

Here we only focused on the backend of this DAX. As a result the frontend is not fully completed.
We suggest to use the contract examples only.
